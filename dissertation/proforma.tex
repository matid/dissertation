\section*{Original Aims}

Evaluate existing approaches for sentiment classification for languages other than English, focusing initally on four languages: German, Italian, Spanish and Polish.

\section*{Work Completed}

The original aims were exceeded by evaluating the language and sentiment filtering assumptions in addition to carrying out the comparison of algorithms as per original aims.

\section*{Project Difficulties}

Both Maximum Entropy and SVM classifiers had proven to be more difficult to implement than anticipated, but both have been incorporated with no or minor impact on project's success.
